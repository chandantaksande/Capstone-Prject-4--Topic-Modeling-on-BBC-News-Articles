# Capstone-Prject-4--Topic-Modeling-on-BBC-News-Articles
This capstone project is about topic modeling on BBC news article data. We use LDA model with BOW, count vectorizer and TF-IDF vectorier.
We cross check performance of LDA model with different text vectorization model, selected the model which performed the best out of these three.
